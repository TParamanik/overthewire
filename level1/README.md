Close the previous connection.
And start a connection using the command:

```bash
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

And then enter the password that we got in level1.

Search for files using command "ls" and we will see that there is file named "-".

To read the content we need to run the command:

```bash
cat ./-
```

Then we will get the password: "263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx"
