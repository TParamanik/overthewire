To log in and clear level0 we need to use the command

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

Then enter the password bandit0

Once we are connected, we can run command:

```bash
ls
```

There is a file readme. All we have to do is read the file using command:

```bash
cat readme
```

Then we will get the password for the next level.
