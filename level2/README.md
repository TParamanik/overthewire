Start a new connection with the command

```bash
ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

then search for the files using command "ls".

To read the file which has spaces in the name, we need to run:

```bash
cat "spaces in this filename"
```

Then we will get the password: "MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx"
